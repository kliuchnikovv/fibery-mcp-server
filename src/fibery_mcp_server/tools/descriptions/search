Search for entities by text/substring matching in specified fields. This tool performs client-side filtering since Fibery API does not expose a dedicated text search endpoint.

IMPORTANT: This tool fetches entities from the database and filters them on the client side. For large databases (>10,000 entities), this may be slow. Use the limit parameter to control performance.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Fetches entities from the specified database (up to limit)
2. Filters results where any search_field contains the query string (case-insensitive)
3. Returns only matching entities

PARAMETERS:
- database: Required. Database name in "Space/Type" format (e.g., "Software Development/Task")
- query: Required. Text to search for (case-insensitive substring matching)
- search_fields: Optional. List of field names to search in. Default: ["Name"]
  Example: ["Software Development/name", "Software Development/Description"]
- return_fields: Optional. Object specifying which fields to return in results.
  Format same as q_select in query_database. Default: {"Name": "Space/name", "Id": "fibery/id"}
- limit: Optional. Maximum number of entities to fetch before filtering. Default: 500, Max: 2000

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Simple search in Name field
{
    "database": "Software Development/Task",
    "query": "mcp",
    "limit": 1000
}
Returns all tasks where Name contains "mcp" (case-insensitive)

Example 2: Search in multiple fields
{
    "database": "Software Development/Task",
    "query": "bug",
    "search_fields": ["Software Development/name", "Software Development/Description"],
    "limit": 500
}
Returns tasks where Name OR Description contains "bug"

Example 3: Custom return fields
{
    "database": "Software Development/Task",
    "query": "mcp",
    "search_fields": ["Software Development/name"],
    "return_fields": {
        "Name": "Software Development/name",
        "Id": "fibery/id",
        "State": ["workflow/state", "enum/name"],
        "Feature": ["Software Development/Feature", "Software Development/Name"]
    },
    "limit": 1000
}

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- Fetching 500 entities typically takes 1-2 seconds
- Fetching 2000 entities may take 5-10 seconds
- Use limit parameter to balance between coverage and performance
- For very large databases, consider using query_database with exact filters instead

LIMITATIONS:
- Cannot search in Rich Text fields (only plain text fields)
- Searches entire field content (no phrase matching or advanced search operators)
- Case-insensitive only (cannot do case-sensitive search)
